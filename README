Blingbling:
----------
Blingbling is a graphical widget library for Awesome Windows Manager. Based on oocairo (http://oocairo.naquadah.org/) it was first an attempt to rewrite the graph and progressbar widgets of Awesome WM. The goal of the Blingbling library is to provide more fancy, customisable and easy to setup graphical widgets, popups or signals for Awesome WM.

Originally, I have written Blingbling for myself but I share it under the GNU GPL-v2 (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html). It meens that for this version, I know it works for me but that all. Testers and feedbacks are welcome!
